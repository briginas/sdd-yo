# SDD Yo implementation plan

## Status

- Active: none
- Complete: Milestones 0–22 and public `sdd-yo@0.5.1`
- Last updated: 2026-08-11

## Authority and navigation

- Implemented product behavior: [`spec/README.md`](spec/README.md)
- Architecture and implementation boundaries:
  [`proposal/architecture/README.md`](proposal/architecture/README.md)
- Execution-planning and closeout procedure:
  [`plans/README.md`](plans/README.md)
- Repository work discipline and validation: [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md)

## Product baseline

SDD Yo is an offline-first, repository-native specification-governance system:
a deterministic TypeScript library, the `sdd` CLI and versioned JSON protocols,
language-independent test adapters, exact approval-bound workflow artifacts,
and an optional progressive-disclosure `sdd-yo` Agent Skill.

The version 1 library, CLI, schemas, proposal and exact-patch workflow, evidence
composition, findings validation, merge readiness, governed-scope integration,
repository-scoped Skill route, and macOS user-scoped Skill with a bound private
CLI are implemented and verified. Normal `spec-code` and `spec` Changes retain
one candidate-and-package bundle. A Skill-owned authored candidate is created
outside the repository through the host temporary boundary and removed after
successful bundle retention; failures preserve it, caller-owned candidates are
not removed, and `code` creates no candidate directory. `code` retains one
package-only bundle and performs no specification-patch ceremony. Proposal
validation, approval recording, preparation, and merge checks consume the exact
retained bundle; superseded `0.4.x` handoff routes are absent.

Exact `sdd-yo@0.5.1` is public on npm from annotated tag `v0.5.1` at commit
`877c25c5f76cb7002eccb9ebbad7ddecb81d6f45`. Its registry tarball matches the
reviewed release subject byte-for-byte with SHA-256
`58d63d00103b06ef70539256bafd18b3faac5fb62dc4ba9d1bc52d9f0141dc8c`,
inventory SHA-256
`db26f2f8520dee2e2717039e771ddd666b11edeaf9814fd77676b4b09c1f646d`,
and 2,138 entries. npm trusted publishing records SLSA provenance for the
GitHub Actions `publish.yml` subject. The public package, CLI identity, library,
schemas, repository Skill, macOS user-scoped private CLI and wrapper, and an
isolated exact consumer installation are verified.

## Candidate backlog

No candidate is selected. Possible future milestones remain deliberately
uncommitted:

- Linux or Windows support;
- a published Codex plugin;
- hosted workflow state or integrations;
- Markdown-dialect changes unrelated to the implemented normal Change
  workflow.

Selecting future work requires a new bounded milestone with an immediate leaf,
explicit exclusions, Requirement traceability, and proportionate validation.
